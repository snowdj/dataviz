Annotated bibliography
----------------------

No single book can cover everything there is to know about a topic. I
encourage you to read other texts on data visualization to deepen your
understanding and to develop your technical skills in making figures.
Here, I provide a limited selection of books that I have personally
found interesting, thought provoking, or helpful. Books listed in
Section @ref(bibliography-thinking) are the most similar in scope to the
present book, and may provide complementary or alternative perspectives
on the topics I have covered. Books listed in Section
@ref(bibliography-programming) address the important topic of how to
make visualizations using programming approaches and available software
libraries. The remaining sections list other books that will expand your
knowledge of data visualization and help you communicate with visuals
and data.

[[bibliography-thinking]]
Thinking about data and visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following books discuss the thought processes and decision making
required for turning data into visualizations. They serve as
introductory texts into how to choose what visualizations to make and
what pitfalls to look out for.

* Alberto Cairo. _"The Truthful Art."_ New Riders, 2016. +
_Excellent all-around introduction to data visualization, in particular
for journalists. The book covers many important concepts of data
visualization, such as how to visualize distributions, trends,
uncertainty, and maps. In many chapters, the book also serves as an
introduction to basic statistical principles, explaining concepts such
as population, sample, and confidence level._
* Stephen Few. _"Show Me the Numbers."_ Analytics Press, 2012. +
_A book about data visualization for the business professional. It is
similar in scope and target audience to the book by Nussbaumer Knaflic
(see below). However, Few’s book contains more material and covers many
topics in more depth. At the same time, the book is not as well written
and as carefully produced as the Nussbaumer Knaflic book._
* Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic. _"Storytelling with Data."_ John Wiley &
Sons, 2015. +
_A well written and carefully produced book on how to turn data into
visuals. The book’s primary audience are people making business
graphics, and the book is excellent for the topics it covers. However,
the book is missing many topics of importance to scientists, such as the
visualization of distributions, trends, or uncertainty._

[[bibliography-programming]]
Programming books
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following books are all how-to books that teach programming
approaches to data visualization.

* Kieran Healy. _"Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction."_
Princeton University Press, 2018. +
_Introduction to using ggplot2 for data visualization. Recommended as
follow-up after Wickham and Grolemund's "R for Data Science" (see
below)._
* Scott Murray. _"Interactive Data Visualization for the Web: An
Introduction to Designing with D3, 2nd Edition."_ O'Reilly Media,
2017. +
_Introduction to making interactive online visualizations with D3, using
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG._
* Jake VanderPlas. _"Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for
Working with Data."_ O'Reilly Media, 2016. +
_Introduction to using the programming language Python for data science.
Has extensive material on data visualization using Python's Matplotlib
and Seaborn._
* Hadley Wickham, Garrett Grolemund. _"R for Data Science."_ O'Reilly
Media, 2017. +
_All-around introduction to using the programming language R for data
science. Contains several chapters on using ggplot2 for data
visualization._

[[statistics-texts]]
Statistics texts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introductory texts in statistics will generally contain material on data
visualization, covering topics such as scatter plots, histograms, box
plots, and line graphs. There are many such texts that could be listed.
Here, I mention just a few recent additions that are worth a closer
look.

* David M. Diez, Christopher D. Barr, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel. _"OpenIntro
Statistics, 3rd Edition."_ OpenIntro, Inc., 2015. +
_Open source introductory statistics text book. The entire book is
freely available, as are the LaTeX files and R code used to compile the
book and make the figures._
* Susan Holmes, Wolfgang Huber. _"Modern Statistics for Modern
Biology."_ 2018. +
_A statistics text that emphasizes computational tools needed for modern
biology. The entire book is freely available, and R code for all
examples is provided._

[[historical-texts]]
Historical texts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The books in this section are of interest primarily for historical
reasons. They were influential at the time of their publication, but
similar material can now be found elsewhere or in more modern form.

* William S. Cleveland. _"Visualizing Data."_ Hobart Press, 1993. +
_Companion book to "The Elements of Graphing Data" by the same author
(see below). This one is more mathematical and doesn't talk about human
perception._
* William S. Cleveland. _"The Elements of Graphing Data, 2nd Edition."_
Hobart Press, 1994. +
_One of the first books about information design written for
statisticians. The book contains many examples of scatter plots, line
graphs, histograms, and boxplots, and it discusses them in the context
of data analysis and statistical modeling. It also popularized the
Cleveland dot plot._
* Edward R. Tufte. _"Envisioning Information."_ Graphics Press, 1990. +
_This book popularized the concept of the small multiple._
* Edward R. Tufte. _"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, 2nd
Edition."_ Graphics Press, 2001. +
_First published in 1983, this book has been highly influential in the
field of data visualization. It introduced concepts such as chart junk,
data-to-ink ratio, and sparklines. The book also showed the first
slopegraph (but didn't name it). However, the book also contains
numerous recommendations that have not stood the test of time. In
particular, it recommends an excessively minimalistic plot design._

[[books-on-broadly-related-topics]]
Books on broadly related topics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following books are all broadly related to the topics of data
visualization and effective communication.

* Joshua Schimel. _"Writing Science."_ Oxford University Press, 2011. +
_Teaches how to write scientific and other technical topics in an
engaging way, by telling a story. While not primarily a book about data
visualization, this is an indispensable text for anybody who needs to
write technical articles and/or proposals._
* Jonathan Schwabish. _"Better Presentations."_ Columbia University
Press, 2016. +
_Short and informative guide for making presentations. A must-read for
anybody who routinely uses slides to give talks or presentations._
* Maureen C. Stone. _"A Field Guide to Digital Color."_ A K Peters,
2003. +
_Comprehensive guide to how colors are captured, processed, and
reproduced by computers._
* Colin Ware. _"Information Visualization, 3rd Edition."_ Morgan
Kaufmann, 2012. +
_A book about principles of visualization, specifically addressing
topics such as how the human visual system works and how different
graphical patterns are perceived. The book covers many different
visualization scenarios, including user interfaces and virtual worlds,
but it puts comparatively less emphasis on visualizing data in the form
of 2D figures._
